  <h3>❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
  <p><strong>Q: Why isn't my right-click registering?</strong><br>
  A: Some browsers may have right-click protection. Try temporarily disabling any context menu scripts or check your browser settings. This is normal behavior for security reasons.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q: The middle-click isn't working. Is my mouse broken?</strong><br>
  A: Not necessarily. Not all mice have a distinct middle button. On laptops or trackpads, try pressing the scroll wheel button firmly or use a three-finger click (on trackpads).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q: Can I test my scroll speed?</strong><br>
  A: Yes! Each scroll action (up or down) is counted. Try scrolling at different speeds to see your scroll wheel's responsiveness.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q: Is this tool accurate for gaming mice?</strong><br>
  A: Yes! This tool works with standard USB HID mouse protocols that all mice use. Gaming mice will work perfectly.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q: Does this test latency/polling rate?</strong><br>
  A: This tool tests button registration but not polling rate. For detailed performance metrics, check your gaming mouse's official software.</p>
  
  <h3>💡 Tips & Tricks</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Test each button multiple times to ensure consistency</li>
