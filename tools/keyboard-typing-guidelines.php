  </ul>
  
  <h3>❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
  <p><strong>Q: What is a good typing speed?</strong><br>
  A: Average typing speed is 40-60 WPM. Professional typists typically type 70-80 WPM. With practice, you can improve significantly.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q: Why does my WPM seem low?</strong><br>
  A: Net WPM accounts for errors, so if you're making many mistakes, your WPM will be lower. Focus on accuracy first, speed will follow.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q: Can I use shortcuts during the test?</strong><br>
  A: Shortcuts are counted as regular keystrokes. The test measures your ability to type the displayed text, so use standard typing methods.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q: How is accuracy calculated?</strong><br>
  A: Accuracy = (Total Characters - Errors) / Total Characters × 100%. You must type exactly what's shown.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q: Can I pause the test?</strong><br>
  A: The timer continues running even if you pause. Focus on typing to maintain consistent time measurement.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Q: Why are some mistakes not highlighted?</strong><br>
  A: Mistakes are highlighted in real-time. Click on any error to see details about what went wrong.</p>
  
  <h3>💡 Tips & Tricks to Improve Your Typing</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Practice Regularly:</strong> Test 2-3 times per week for consistent improvement</li>
    <li><strong>Focus on Accuracy First:</strong> Speed naturally increases when you reduce errors</li>
    <li><strong>Use Proper Finger Positioning:</strong> Home row position (ASDF for left hand, JKL; for right hand) is essential</li>
    <li><strong>Don't Look at the Keyboard:</strong> Touch typing (without looking) is much faster than hunt-and-peck</li>
    <li><strong>Take Short Breaks:</strong> Rest your fingers between tests to avoid strain</li>
    <li><strong>Review Mistake Patterns:</strong> If you notice you frequently mistype certain letter combinations, practice those specifically</li>
    <li><strong>Use the Heatmap:</strong> Check which keys cause you trouble and dedicate practice time to them</li>
    <li><strong>Increase Difficulty Gradually:</strong> Start with easy passages, progress to harder ones as you improve</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>🎯 Setting Performance Goals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Beginner Goal (0-40 WPM):</strong> Master touch typing and build muscle memory</li>
    <li><strong>Intermediate Goal (40-70 WPM):</strong> Increase speed while maintaining 95%+ accuracy</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Goal (70-100 WPM):</strong> Develop competitive typing speed</li>
    <li><strong>Expert Goal (100+ WPM):</strong> Achieve professional-level speed and accuracy</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>🚀 Common Typing Errors & How to Fix Them</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Missed Spaces:</strong> Remember to type the space between words—many errors come from forgetting spaces</li>
    <li><strong>Wrong Finger Used:</strong> Train proper finger positions using the home row technique</li>
    <li><strong>Homophones (to/too/two):</strong> Slow down slightly when typing similar-sounding words</li>
    <li><strong>Capitalization Mistakes:</strong> Pay careful attention to capital letters in the passage</li>
    <li><strong>Punctuation Errors:</strong> Don't skip periods, commas, or other punctuation marks</li>
    <li><strong>Speed Over Accuracy:</strong> Slow down—rushing causes more errors than typing at a steady pace</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>📱 Mobile vs Desktop Typing</h3>
  <p>This tool works on both mobile and desktop devices:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Desktop Keyboard:</strong> Use any standard or mechanical keyboard for testing</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Keyboard:</strong> On-screen keyboards are supported but typically result in slower speeds</li>
    <li><strong>External Keyboard:</strong> Connect Bluetooth keyboards to mobile devices for desktop-like experience</li>
    <li><strong>Gaming Keyboards:</strong> Mechanical keyboards may show improved speed and reduced errors</li>
  </ul>
